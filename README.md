## SvelteKit project

It makes use of SvelteKit's `adapter-static` to output the site as static HTML files.

This repo is here so you can poke around if you want to, suggest improvements, or use this as a loose blueprint for your own SvelteKit blog project. (Please don't completely copy my design, though. This is here to learn and draw from, not to reuse as-is.)

## Running locally

Assuming you already have Node and NPM installed, clone the repo, then in the directory, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Thanks to Josh Collinsworth for sharing his [work](https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/joco-sveltekit) as an inspiration and a starting point for my Svelte journey.
