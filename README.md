# joco-sveltekit

My affectionate nickname for the SvelteKit build of [joshcollinsworth.com](https://joshcollinsworth.com). It makes use of SvelteKit's `adapter-static` to output the site as static HTML files.

This repo is here so you can poke around if you want to, suggest improvements, or use this as a starter for your own SvelteKit blog project.
