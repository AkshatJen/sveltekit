I just finished _The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom_ this morning, after close to 100 hours of exploring this version of Hyrule for the second time around (the first, of course, being in _Breath of the Wild_, _Tears_' predecessor).

There are many game series like Zelda which, while containing many entries, aren't exactly cohesive. While the stories of all of the _Zelda_ games tie together in some ways, each entry also has a more-or-less standalone story. They often reference one another, and have a few recurring characters and themes, but are only loosely connected by lore. The hero in one _Zelda_ game isn't generally the same actual person as the hero in another _Zelda_ game. A true sequel is rare in the series (though not unprecedented), which is part of what made the release of TotK such an eagerly anticipated event.

The other, of course, is that _Breath of the Wild_ is widely considered one of the best video games ever made. I personally feel it's a bit overrated, but still great, and I still enjoyed it for somewhere around 70–80 hours of my life, years ago.

So all told, I'm closing in on 200 hours of Zelda on Switch (which might sound like a lot if you're not a gamer, but it doesn't take very many nights and weekends, really, to get to that point. Most _Zelda_ fans I know have hundreds of hours in just one game or the other).

I agree with what seems to be critical consensus: _Tears of the Kingdom_ is even better than its predecessor.

However, I _also_ think it's deeply unfair to even make the comparison.

I'll come back to why, after covering a bit of what makes folks (myself included) feel _Tears_ is such an improvement.


## What's improved?

First off, while most _Zelda_ fans seem to hold _Breath of the Wild_ in a reverence generally reserved for the deeply religious, it's still pretty widely agreed that the game's dungeons (the "Divine Beasts") were a weak point. I agree, and was pleased to see that while _some_ of the Palaces that replace the Beasts are a bit similar, they mostly are more like the deeper, more complex dungeons that I preferred from earlier in the series' history.

Next, the story is noticeably improved. While weak points still exist (it's hard to tell a linear story in a decidedly non-linear game, and much of the exposition has to be vague and repetitive because there's no way of predicting when the player will uncover what), it's still a more interesting tale told in what I found to be a more compelling way—and with a more epic ending as well. (As in _Breath of the Wild_, the last phase of the last boss fight is almost more set piece than battle, but it's a much more interesting one this time around.)

And of course, there's much, much more to explore. In addition to the surface Hyrule—reused almost entirely as-is from _Breath of the Wild—there are floating islands high in the sky, and the dark, cavernous depths accessible via seemingly bottomless holes dotted throughout the overworld.

I should also mention the game's marquee new ability, Ultrahand, which lets you build things. You know all about building things by this point. You probably saw dozens of crazy, hilarious inventions players made before the game was a day old. I like Ultrahand; I also thought it was a little gimmicky. I don't think we need to dwell on it too much, in any case, though. It serves to deepen the sandbox, and give the player some options for getting themselves out of situations they'd rather not force their way through, both of which I appreciated. But I don't think I have the drive to spend hours seeing what I can put together in a video game. If I'm being creative, I have better tools and better venues.


## How can we compare?

_Breath of the Wild_ was, presumably, built more or less from scratch.
